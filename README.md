# Astro Cloudflare Template

This repository provides a ready-to-use template for building web projects using Astro, tailored for deployment on Cloudflare with Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes a robust setup with tools like Husky for pre-commit linting, ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations to ensure code quality and consistency.

Read [this article](https://devdesigndaily.com/astro-and-cloudflare) to learn why we love Astro and Cloudflare.

## Features

- **Astro Configuration**: Pre-configured to optimize your development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated for rapid UI development.
- **Cloudflare Ready**: Ready for deployment to Cloudflare with necessary configurations.
- **Code Quality Tools**:
  - **ESLint**: Helps in identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
  - **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter to maintain code style consistency.
  - **Husky**: Manages pre-commit hooks to lint your code before commits.
  - **GitHub Dependency Checks**: Ensures your dependencies are secure and up-to-date.

## Image Handling

The template uses a passthrough image service by default in the Astro configuration. This is essentially a no-op configuration â€” it does not alter or process images but simply serves them as is. If you require different image handling, such as integration with Cloudflare Images or another service, modify the `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript
image: {
  service: yourImageService(),
},
```

## Environment Variables

To use environment variables within your Astro project, configure them in the `astro.config.mjs` under the `vite` section as shown below:

```javascript
vite: {
  define: {
    'process.env.SOME_API_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.SOME_API_KEY),
  },
},
```

You can then access these variables in your code:

```javascript
if (!import.meta.env.SOME_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error('SOME_API_KEY not set');
}
```

Make sure to replace `SOME_API_KEY` with your actual environment variable keys.
